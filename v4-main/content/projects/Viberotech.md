An accessibility-focused music experience that translates audio into vibrotactile feedback, enabling d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing users to experience music through touch.
The prototype demonstrates controlled frequency sweeps, burst rattle tests, and track-level vibrotactile mapping using moderate-cost hardware.
Designed and built by Anirudh Dabas, with an emphasis on open access, community participation, and inclusive design.
