An end-to-end eCommerce platform with real authentication, product APIs, cart and wishlist workflows, and secure checkout.

Built backend services using Express + MongoDB with indexed queries, schema validation, and optimized product retrieval. Integrated Supabase Auth with row-level security for protected user data, and implemented Razorpay payments with webhook-driven order updates and status sync.

This platform previously ran in production with live APIs, payment processing, and authenticated user flows. After the underlying business shut down, the hosted API infrastructure was intentionally decommissioned — but the full backend logic and integrations remain implemented in the system, reflecting its original production architecture and behavior.
